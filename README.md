# Ring Control widget for Android

## Intro

For years I used an widget from the Play Store to control the ring volume on my phone.  One day I needed to wipe my phone and reinstall everything from scratch, and to my surprise that app no longer worked on Android 16.  Don't know why.  That's why I wrote this app.

## Requirements

This app was developed on Android 16 but was tested on Android 11 (API 30).  There is no guarantee it will work on anything later.

## Bug Reports

At this time I haven't added any functionality in the app to generate crash reports.  But when I do, the process will got something like this:
1. a file named *ringcontrol_logcat-<datetime>.txt* will be written to the *Downloads* filter of your phone
2. you will upload that file to ["Issues"](https://github.com/khpylon/RIngControl/issues) on GitHub
3. I'll try to figure out why the app crashed and how to fix it
